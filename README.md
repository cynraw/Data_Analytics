## Select statement in mysql
- Used to work with columns and select what columns you want to see in your output.
- You have to specify the database before querying the selected columns.
- You can specify by double clicking on the database on the left menu or you can use the syntax:
     - SELECT * FROM database_name.column_name;
- We can select all the columns or specific columns.
     - SELECT * -selects all the columns in the database
     - SELECT first_name -selects the column named first_name
     - SELECT first_name,last_name,dob -selects all those columns mentioned
- N/B: Any math within mysql follows the rules of PEMDAS- this is the order of operations within mysql.
- Stands for Parenthesis, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.
- DISTINCT - selects only the unique values ie in a gender column it will return make and female.
